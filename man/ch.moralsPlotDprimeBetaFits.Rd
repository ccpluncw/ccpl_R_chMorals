\title{A function to plot the dPrime and Beta by OverlapRound for the Morals data.}
\usage{
ch.moralsPlotDprimeBetaFits(data, overlapRoundCol, correctCol, correctVals,
  targetPresentCol, targetPresentVals, addCorrection = TRUE,
  filename = NULL, cex1 = 1.25, printR2 = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the morals dataframe after running through ch.moralsDataPrep().}

\item{overlapRoundCol}{a string that specifies the name of the column in "data" that contains the overlap round column.}

\item{correctCol}{a string the specifies the column name in "data" that contains the variable whether the participant's response was correct.}

\item{correctVals}{a vector of two values that specifies the "correct" value (index 1) and the "incorrect" value (index 2). e.g, c("yes", "no")}

\item{targetPresentCol}{a string that specifies the name of the column in "data" that contains the whether or not the target was presented.}

\item{targetPresentVals}{a vector of two values that specifies the "target present" value (index 1) and the "target absent" value (index 2). e.g, c("yes", "no")}

\item{addCorrection}{a boolean that specifies whether you want a .5 correction to be added the total hits, FAs, misses, and CRs. This corrects for 0 and 1 values for FA and Hits. DEFAULT = T.}
}
\value{
a list containing the lm fit for the dPrime by OverlapRound (dPrimeFit) and the lm fit for the beta by OverlapRound (betaFit).
}
\description{
This function plots the dPrime and Beta by OverlapRound for the Morals data.
